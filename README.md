This is the accompanying source code for the paper presented at the 3rd Workshop on Data Mining for Medical Informatics (http://www.dmmh.org/dmmi16), held in conjunction with the AMIA 2016 Annual Symposium (https://www.amia.org/amia2016).  
  
This repository contains the code developed for assessing the impact of the drug classification systems (DCSs) on the analysis of our dataset of Medicare Part D claims. Please note that the code requires of data files (maps between NDCs, RxNorm products, and drug classes) that are not available in this repository. The code released here is intended for transparency and didactic purposes.

Please feel free to contact us about this project! E-mail Fabrício directly: *fabricio.kury at nih.gov*.  
Reading and reusing source code can become so much easier after a quick voice talk with the original authors of the code -- we will be glad to help.
